## AI Image Generator

An AI image generator is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to generate new images from existing ones or from a set of random inputs. 

## Javascript Bot

A JSbot using OpenAI API is a JavaScript implementation of a chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's language processing models to understand and respond to user input. It provide users with a conversational interface for various tasks such as answering questions about javascript related topics.

## SQL Translator

A SQL translator using OpenAI API is a tool that utilizes OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to translate human-written natural language queries into SQL statements that can be executed on a database. It allows non-technical users to interact with databases using natural language, making it easier to extract insights and data.

## AI Tutor

An AI tutor is a type of educational software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide personalized instruction and feedback to students. It can adapt to a student's learning style and abilities, and provide tailored lessons and exercises to help them learn and improve. 

## Ask Anything

An "ask anything" web app is a type of application that allows users to ask questions and receive answers from the app in real time. This can be accomplished through the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand and interpret the user's question, and provide a relevant and accurate response. These web apps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as generating mails, report, essay,etc...

## Measuring Complexity

A "complexity measuring" web app is a type of application that uses algorithms to analyze and quantify the complexity of a given text or code.

## Bug Fixer

AI bug fixers are computer programs designed to automatically detect and fix software bugs. These programs use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze code and identify errors, and then automatically fix them.

## Q&A

It uses AI algorithms to automatically generate answers to questions in natural language text.
